# Face_Recognition
This Repo consists of 2 python files, one for creating a database and another one to actually detect the face using the database (You have to train it first), excluding these 2 file there is another file which is a ".xml" file.
It's basically a machine learning project where an individual have to train model and then the model can be used for the face detection for that individual.
